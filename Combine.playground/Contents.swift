/*
 ombine was introduced as a new framework by Apple at WWDC-2019. It provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time.
 
 Publishers and Subscribers
 A Publisher exposes values (that can change) on which a subscriber subscribes to receive all those updates. If you relate them to RxSwift:

 Publishers are like Observables
 Subscribers are like Observers
 A Combine publisher is an object that sends values to its subscribers over time. Sometimes this is a single value, and other times a publisher can transmit multiple values or no values at all.
