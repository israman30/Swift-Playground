 `Map
 Mapping is similar to sort in that it iterates through the array that is calling it, but instead of sorting it changes each element of the array based on the closure passed to the method.
 
 ```
 let element = numbers.map( transform: (Int) throws -> T)
 ```
 Notice that the return of the closure is a T. Since an array is a generic type and we are returning a new array, we can return an array with a type different than the starting array (if we so choose). Lets convert our numbers into strings.

 `Filter
 the filter method will return an array that has only elements that pass your filter specified in your closure.

/**
 `Reduce
 The reduce function allows you to combine all the elements in an array and return an object of any type (generics!!!!)
 ```
 let element = numbers.reduce(initialResult: Result, nextPartialResult: (Result, Int) throws -> Result)
 ```
 Notice that reduce has two parameters â€” initialResult and nextPartialResult. We need the initial result to tell us where to start, and the method then operates on that result based on the logic in the closure.
